# mybiz.style

mybiz.style is a template R package for implementing colour palettes and a ggplot2 theme.

* Colour palettes based on [Dr Simon Jackson's Corporate Colour Palettes'](https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/creating-corporate-colour-palettes-for-ggplot2).
* ggplot themes inspired by the [Storytelling With Data style](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) and a burning desire to get font sizes consistent in my plots.

## How To

* Fork from the repo
* Update `./data-raw/colours.R` with your colours and desired prefix and run it
* Go through everything in `./R` replacing 'mybiz_' with your desired prefix
* Build the package (CMD + SHIFT + B)
* Share with others + build on it!

## TO DO

* Automate prefix replacement if possible
