#' ouRstyle: your colours and ggplot2 theme
#' 
#' ouRstyle provides a template allowing users to specify colours and colour
#' palettes which are then built into a package of functions allowing them to
#' be used in R. A plot theme is also provided that can be customised to reflect
#' your brand / aesthetic.
#' 
#' * Colour palettes based on Dr Simon Jackson's Corporate Colour Palettes: \url{https://drsimonj.svbtle.com/creating-corporate-colour-palettes-for-ggplot2}.
#' * Horizontal plot approach from ggthemes: \url{https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes/blob/master/R/economist.R}.
